# Binary-Exploitation-Starter-Kit
config, templates and resources I've collected for linux binary exploitation for ctfs

## Programming Language
there are many resources out there to learn different programming languages, but I will mention the ones that I've learned from

C - all of the glibc are written in C, so you need to know C at least the basics including pointers

Assembly - you need to learn many assembly languages in your journey with binary exploitation but first learn x86 (32-bit) assembly, then x86_64 (64-bit) assembly. After learning those two, you should be familiary with registers and cpu instructions.

Python - the best for writing exploit scripts and I highly recommend to learn python if you haven't. I recommend to learn both python2 and python3 because old exploit scripts are written in python2 and modern exploit scripts are written in python3 especially in ctfs.

## Debuggers
the job of a debugger is to do debugging the executable, instruction by instruction, checking memory layouts after a instruction, examine stack, heap and other 
memory regions, etc.
There are a lot of gdb plugins but my favourite is gef, pwndbg and peda.
- [gef](https://github.com/hugsy/gef]) - really good gdb plugin, actively maintained and stable
- [pwndbg](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) - older than gef and also a good tool
- [peda](https://github.com/longld/peda) - old gdb plugin but this works very well on old systems if you are trying to write exploits on an old OS, this is good

## Text Editors
these are the tools that you edit your exploit codes, ofc you can use whatever you like it's up to you
- [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - I prefer VSCode due to its simplicity and easy configuration.
- [neovim](https://neovim.io/) - If you love terminal and do not want to switch to gui, this will be your choice. Configuration is easier in neovim than vanilla vim due to its support for lua scripts. But if you really want to focus on exploit development rather than learning how to use properly a text editor, you should avoid this. Trust me it took me a long time to code in neovim/vim well.

## Learning Resources
the problem with self-study is that you don't exactly know where to learn because there are a lot of resources out there and the information is scattered on the internet. Here are some of the resources you can learn linux binexp from scratch.
- [nightmare](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/00-intro/index.html) - Detailed presentation of binary exploitation techniques from 0 to ctf-ready level. Choose this if you prefer reading rather than watching videos
- [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/) - Arizona State University's binary exploitation course and it is actively maintained too, very good resource and the professors are really good pwners, they were parts of shellphish ctf team. Nice presentations, excellent challenges and detailed explaination
- [azeria-labs](https://azeria-labs.com/) - Detailed explanation of different exploitation techniques
